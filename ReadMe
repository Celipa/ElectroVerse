This is my Examination assignment for Javascript 2


I have used

Context, react-icons, Axios and react-router-dom

This is my grading assignment for Javascript 2 where our assignment was to make an e-commerce webpage for electronics.
Our teacher provided us with a custom API he built, which is why some components may be in Swedish.

I have added some extra components that are just to make the page look "better" for my own sake. 
For example, I have added a profile button, logout button, and orders button in the ''settings'' dropdown. The profile page has no function, but is just because I wanted to add it myself. 
However, the orders button and the logout button work if the user is logged in.

Everything on the website should work as instructed in the task, but an error can occur when you press a button in one of the dropdowns that are available, and the button does nothing. 
It is a styling error on my end as it is only possible to press the text itself to move on.

Recently I noticed a bug with the Register button where nothing happens when the user registers, the code itself is correct so I believe this is an API issue.

For this project, I did not spend time on making modules for popups, so their placeholder, for now, is an alert popup until I update it.

Dropdowns may occasionally bug and not work when you try to close them. Dropdown works for all components in normal cases. If that happens, you can reload the website and they will work again.
